# Image Conversion: Color to Grayscale and Binary


This project provides MATLAB code to convert a colored image to grayscale and binary (black-and-white). It reads an image, converts it to grayscale using a weighted sum method, and then converts it to a binary image by calculating a threshold.

To use this code, ensure that the image file (e.g., apple.jpeg) is in the working directory. 

### Example Output
Grayscale Image: Displays the image in shades of gray.
Binary Image: Displays the image in black and white based on pixel intensity.
